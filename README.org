* Setup for Building Lecture Slides Locally
To build these lecture slides locally on your machine you'll need an up-to-date
version of LaTeX such as [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][texlive]] or [[https://miktex.org/][MikTex]].

You may need to "install" FAU's custom beamer theme. To do so, simply copy or
create a shortcut (symlink) to =<KDD location>/lecture/themefau= in the
corresponding place depending on your operating system. For a standard
installation on Linux or Mac OS this place is one of the following:
- Linux: =~/texmf/tex/latex/local/=
- Mac OS X: =//Users/<user name>/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local/=

For a MikTex installation under Windows, it is recommended to first create
a new TEXMF root directory in the MikTex Console under Settings -> Directories.
The recommended path is usually =C:\Users\[Username]\mytexmf= (Purpose: Generic -
Attribute: User). The shortcut (symlink) to the theme must then be added under
the specified path in the subfolder =\tex\latex=.

For more information see this [[https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1137/where-do-i-place-my-own-sty-or-cls-files-to-make-them-available-to-all-my-te][entry]].

* Setup for Commiting

We use the framework [[https://pre-commit.com/][pre-commit]] to manage our
pre-commit hooks. This simplifies the maintenance of the hooks - especially
on heterogeneous systems - but requires an initial installation process
of the individual users.

First, the framework itself must be installed. This process is explained on
the framework's website under [[https://pre-commit.com/#install]["Installation"]].

The second thing that needs to be done is to install the pre-commit hooks themselves.
This can be achieved by running the command =pre-commit install= in the root
directory of this project.

We assume that each commit has been validated with these pre-commit hooks
and will not accept pull requests that contain unvalidated commits
(the pre-commit hooks are also checked again on the server side by a GitHub action).

*(Current) other prerequisites:*
- The latex package [[latexindent][https://ctan.org/pkg/latexindent]]
- Nodejs and npm

*Note for Windows users:*
One of the hooks uses [[https://github.com/cmhughes/latexindent.pl][latexindent.pl]].
This is usually not installed correctly by MikTex and other package managers.
Instead, download the ZIP archive of the [[https://github.com/cmhughes/latexindent.pl/releases][latest release]]
and copy the latexindent.exe and the defaultSettings.yaml into a directory
that you then specify in the Windows $PATH environment variable.
