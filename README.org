* Setup for Building Lecture Slides Locally
To build these lecture slides locally on your machine you'll need an up-to-date
version of LaTeX such as [[https://www.tug.org/texlive/][texlive]] or [[https://miktex.org/][MikTex]].

* Setup for Commiting
We use the framework [[https://pre-commit.com/][pre-commit]] to manage our
pre-commit hooks. This simplifies the maintenance of the hooks - especially
on heterogeneous systems - but requires an initial installation process
of the individual users.

First, the framework itself must be installed. This process is explained on
the framework's website under [[https://pre-commit.com/#install]["Installation"]].

The second thing that needs to be done is to install the pre-commit hooks themselves.
This can be achieved by running the command =pre-commit install= in the root
directory of this project.

We assume that each commit has been validated with these pre-commit hooks
and will not accept pull requests that contain unvalidated commits
(the pre-commit hooks are also checked again on the server side by a GitHub action).
