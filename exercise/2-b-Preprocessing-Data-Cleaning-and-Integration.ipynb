    "- <b>MiddleName:</b> Some `None` values in the MiddleName are quite normal as not every person might have a middle name. However, it is still possible that this value is missing.\n",
    "- <b>Suffix:</b> Even if the first 25 tuples contain only `None` values, this column also contains values like `III` and `Jr.` Since also in the normal case not many people carry such a suffix in the name, it seems quite valid that there are also many `Null` values here.\n",

    "- <b>Title:</b> If the non-`None` values in Title were academic titles such as \"Dr.\" or \"Prof.\" it would be expected that these titles do not actually exist for every employee. However, since titles such as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\" are also used, it can be assumed that information is simply missing. It should definitely be possible to specify these titles for each employee.\n",

    "<u>Attributes difficult to assess:</u>\n",

    "- <b>OrganizationNode:</b> There is also a `None` value in the OrganizationNode attribute. However, this is assigned to the CEO of all people (see JobTitle). It is quite possible that only employees with superiors should be assigned to an OrganizationNode. However, this could also be an error as the CEO may have been with the company the longest and may simply have forgotten to add his OrganizationNode."
