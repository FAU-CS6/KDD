\section{What kind of applications are targeted?}

\begin{frame}{Applications of Data Mining (I)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Wherever there is data and more knowledge is desired,
			      there are data mining applications.}\\
		\item Typical data mining applications:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item \textbf{Business Intelligence} \\
			            \small{Provides historical, current, and predictive views of
				            business operation.}
			      \item \textbf{Web Search Engines} \\
			            \small{Need to decide which pages to index, which ones to
				            index and how to rank them for search.}
			      \item \textbf{Fraud detection} \\
			            \small{Possible fraud attempts automatically based on
				            suspicious patterns in transactions.}
			      \item \textbf{Predictive Maintenance} \\
			            \small{Evaluation of sensor data to maintain machines in time
				            before a defect occurs.}
		      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Applications of Data Mining (II)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Example research projects using data mining at FAU\footnote{Found
			      in the FAU CRIS (Current research information system):
			      \url{https://cris.fau.de/}}:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item \textbf{Prediction of product properties using data mining
				            methods} \\
			            \small{Prof. Dr.-Ing. Sandro Wartzack (Chair of Engineering
				            Design)}
			      \item \textbf{Combustion and fuel optimization for the utilization
				            of residues in biomass furnaces} \\
			            \small{Prof. Dr.-Ing. Jürgen Karl (Chair of Energy Process
				            Engineering)}
			      \item \textbf{CoralTrace – A new approach to understanding
				            climate-induced reef crises} \\
			            \small{Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Kießling (Chair of Palaeontology)}
			      \item \textbf{Performance Analysis in Team Sports} \\
			            \small{Prof. Dr. Björn Eskofier (Machine Learning and Data
				            Analytics Lab)}
			      \item \textbf{And many more ...} \\
			            \small{The chair of computer science 6 (data management)
				            has some projects related to data mining, too. More
				            information will be given in the last lecture.}
