\begin{frame}{A Multidimensional View of Data Mining}
	\textbf{Data mining projects can be described in four dimensions:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{What data is available?}:\\
		      \small{
			      Data can exist in a wide variety of forms and must therefore be
			      treated differently in data mining.
		      }
		\item \textbf{What patterns are searched for?}:\\
		      \small{
			      Various functions in data mining can be used to detect
			      different patterns.
		      }
		\item \textbf{What technologies are used?}:\\
		      \small{
			      The technologies used can vary greatly in data mining.
		      }
		\item \textbf{What is the actual target application?}:\\
		      \small{
			      The actual target application also differs from case to case.
		      }
