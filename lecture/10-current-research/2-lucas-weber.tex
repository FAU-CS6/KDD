	\frametitle{Classification of heterogenous sensor signals from power plants}
	Power plants, regardless of their construction, must be intensively maintained and monitored to ensure constantly efficient power generation and to minimize the risk of damage. Sensors measure pressure, temperature, enthalpy, electrical resistance, etc., and their readings are recorded for this reason in order to monitor them. Since power plant operators operate at an international level, there is a need to evaluate information from power plants whose measured values are organized and stored in accordance with the norms that are standard for the specific country.
