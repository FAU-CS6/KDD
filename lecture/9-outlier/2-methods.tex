\begin{frame}{How can we detect outliers?}
	\textbf{Two ways to categorize outlier-detection methods:}

	Grouping according to
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{How many samples are labeled:}}\\
		      I.e. supervised, semi-supervised vs. unsupervised methods.
		\item \textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Assumptions}} regarding normal and abnormal samples.\\
		      I.e. statistical, proximity-based, and clustering-based methods.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Outlier Detection: Grouping According to Label Existence I}
	Domain expert labelled all, some, or no samples.
	\vspace*{1em}
	\textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Supervised Methods:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Modeling outlier detection as a \textbf{classification problem}:\\
		      Samples examined by domain experts used for training \& testing.
		\item Methods for learning a classifier for outlier detection effectively:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Model normal objects \& report those not matching the model as outliers.
			      \item Model outliers and treat those not matching the model as normal.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Challenges:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Imbalanced classes, i.e., outliers are rare: \\
			            Boost the outlier class and make up some artificial outliers.
			      \item Catch as many outliers as possible. \\
			            Therefore: recall is more important than accuracy \\
			            (i.e., not mislabeling normal objects as outliers).
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Outlier Detection: Grouping According to Label Existence II}
	\textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Unsupervised Methods:}}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item No labels available.
		\item \textbf{Implicit assumptions:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item \textcolor{faugray}{Normal objects are someqhat ``clustered''} into multiple groups, each having some distinct features.
			      \item Outlier are expected to be far away from any group of normal objects.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item Adapt clustering methods for unsupervised outlier detection:
		      \begin{enumerate}
			      \item Find clusters.
			      \item Samples not falling in any cluster are outliers.
		      \end{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Challenges:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Samples outside of clusters may not be outliers.
			      \item Costly to find clusters.
			      \item Hard to distinguish noise from outliers.
			      \item Can't detect collective outliers effectively.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Outlier Detection: Grouping According to Label Existence III}
	\textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Semi-Supervised Methods:}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Only a small set of samples are labeled as normal or as outlier.
		\item \textbf{If some {\color{airforceblue}labeled normal objects} are available:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Use the labeled examples and the proximate \\
			            unlabeled objects to train a model for normal objects.
			      \item Those not fitting the model of normal objects are detected as outliers.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{If only some {\color{airforceblue}labeled outliers} are available, \\ that small number may not cover all possible outliers well.}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item To improve the quality of outlier detection: get help from models for normal objects learned from unsupervised methods.
		      \end{itemize}

	\textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Statistical Methods}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item (Also known as model-based methods)
		\item Assume that the \textbf{\color{airforceblue}normal data follow some statistical model}.
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item The data not following the model are outliers.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Example (right figure):}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item First use Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}_D(x \; \vert \; \mu,\sigma)$ to model the normal data.
			      \item For each object $y$ in region $R$, estimate $\mathcal{N}_D(y \; \vert \; \mu, \sigma)$, the probability that $y$ \\
			            fits the Gaussian distribution.
			      \item If $\mathcal{N}_D(y \; \vert \; \mu, \sigma)$ is very low, $y$ is unlikely generated by the Gaussian model, thus an outlier.
		      \end{itemize}
		      \item\textbf{Effectiveness of statistical methods:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Highly depends on whether the assumption of statistical model holds in the real data.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{There are many kinds of statistical models.}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item E.g., parametric vs. non-parametric.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Outlier Detection: Grouping Based on Assumption II}
	\tikzoverlay at (11cm,1cm) {\input{9-outlier/general-outlier.tex}};
	\textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Proximity-Based Methods}}

	An object is an outlier if the \textbf{\color{airforceblue}nearest neighbors of the object are far away},\\ i.e., the proximity of the object significantly deviates from the proximity\\ of most of the other objects in the same data set.
	\begin{itemize}

		\item \textbf{Example (right figure):}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Model the proximity of an object using its 3 nearest neighbors.
			      \item Objects in region R are substantially different from other objects in the data set.
			      \item Thus the objects in R are outliers.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Effectiveness of proximity-based methods:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Highly relies on the proximity measure.
			      \item In some applications, proximity or distance measures cannot be obtained easily.
			      \item Often have a difficulty in finding a group of outliers which are close to each other.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Two major types of proximity-based outlier detection:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Distance-based vs. density-based.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Outlier Detection: Grouping Based on Assumption III}
	\tikzoverlay at (11cm,1cm) {\input{9-outlier/general-outlier.tex}};
	\textcolor{faugray}{\textbf{Clustering-Based Methods}}

	Normal data belong to large and dense clusters, whereas outliers belong to\\ \textbf{\color{airforceblue}small or sparse clusters}, or do not belong to any cluster.
	\begin{itemize}

		\item \textbf{Example (right figure): Two clusters.}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item All points not in R form a large cluster.
			      \item The two points in R form a tiny cluster, thus are outliers.

		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Many clustering methods:}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Thus also many clustering-based outlier detection methods.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Clustering is expensive.}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Straightforward adaptation of a clustering method for outlier detection can be costly and does not scale up well for large data sets.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
