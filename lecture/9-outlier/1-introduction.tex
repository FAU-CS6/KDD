\section{Outlier and Outlier Analysis}


\begin{frame}{What are Outliers?}
	\begin{block}{Outlier}
		An \textit{outlier} is a data tuple that \underline{deviates significantly} from normal data tuples as if generated by a different mechanism.
	\end{block}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Outliers are \textcolor{faugray}{different from noise}.}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Noise is a random error or variance in a measured variable.
			      \item Noise should be removed before outlier detection.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Outliers are \textcolor{faugray}{interesting}.}
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item They violate the mechanism that generates data tuples that are considered normal.
			      \item Could occur by chance, measurement error, or any other reason.\newline $\rightarrow$ Justification \textit{why} a tuple is an outlier is important.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Outlier detection vs. novelty detection:} Early stage: outlier; but later merged into the model.
		\item \textbf{Applications:} fraud detection, customer segmentation, medical analyis, industry damage detection.
	\end{itemize}

	Three kinds: global, contextual, and collective outliers
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Global} outlier (or \textbf{\color{faugray}point anomaly}):
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Significantly deviates from the rest of the data set.
			      \item Simplest form of outlier, therefore, most methods focus on finding these.
			      \item Issue: Find an appropriate measurement of deviation.
		      \end{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Contextual} outlier (or \textbf{\color{faugray}conditional outlier}):
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item Deviates significantly based on a selected context.
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item Example: Is 23Â°C in Erlangen an outlier? (Depending on summer or winter).
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item Attributes of data objects divided into two groups:
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item \textbf{Contextual attributes}: define the context, e.g., time \& location.
				            \item \textbf{Behavioral attributes}: characteristics of the object, used in outlier evaluation, e.g., temperature.
			            \end{itemize}
			      \item Can be viewed as a generalization of local outliers ({\color{faugray} density significantly deviates from its local area}).
			      \item Issue: Formulation of a meaningful context.
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\setcounter{enumi}{2}
		\item \textbf{Collective} outlier:
		      \begin{itemize}
			      \item A \textbf{subset} of data objects that collectively \\
			            deviates significantly from the whole data set.
			      \item Example: intrusion detection -- a number of computers \\
			            keep sending denial-of-service packages to each other.
			      \item \textbf{Detection of collective outliers:}
			            \begin{itemize}
				            \item Consider not only behavior of individual objects, but also that of groups of objects.
				            \item Need to have the background knowledge on the relationship among data objects, such as a distance or similarity measure on objects.
			            \end{itemize}
		      \end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}

	\begin{alertblock}{Outliers in a Data Set}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{A data set may have multiple types of outliers.}
			\item \textbf{One data tuple may belong to more than one type of outlier.}
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{columns}
		\begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Modeling normal objects and outliers properly.}
				      \begin{itemize}
					      \item Hard to enumerate all possible normal behaviors in an application.
					      \item No clear line between normal data tuples and outliers.
				      \end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Application-specific outlier detection.}
				      \begin{itemize}
					      \item Choice of distance measure among objects and the model of \\
					            relationship among objects are application-dependent.
					      \item E.g. clinical data: a small deviation could be an outlier; \\
					            while in marketing analysis: larger fluctuations.
				      \end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}

		\begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Handling noise in outlier detection.}
				      \begin{itemize}
					      \item Noise may distort the normal objects and blur the distinction \\
					            between normal objects and outliers.
					      \item It may hide outliers and reduce the effectiveness of outlier detection.
				      \end{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Understandability.}
				      \begin{itemize}
					      \item Understand why these are outliers: justification of the detection.
					      \item Specify the degree of an outlier: \\
					            the unlikelihood of the object being generated by a normal mechanism.
