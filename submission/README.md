# Submissions

Starting from the summer semester of 2024, KDD has been supplemented with submissions in addition to the lecture and exercises.

These assignments are automatically graded using GitHub Classroom.

Students who achieve 60% of the points across all three assignments can unlock the mock exam for KDD.

## Submissions

The submissions are introduced in the form of PDFs. These contain the most important tasks that students need to complete. Like the lecture slides and exercise sheets, these PDFs are automatically generated by GitHub Actions.

## Code Skeletons

In each submission, students receive a code skeleton, along with some test cases and helper classes (mainly intended to support the tests). These code skeletons are integrated into this repository as Git submodules. They can be directly downloaded using a recursive clone.

## (Sample) Solutions

For each assignment, there is also a sample solution, which is similarly integrated into this repository via Git submodule. However, since students are expected to develop their own solutions and not simply copy the sample solution, the corresponding code is private and can only be cloned recursively if one has read access to the relevant repositories within the organization [FAU-CS6-KDDmUe-Submissions](https://github.com/FAU-CS6-KDDmUe-Submissions). These permissions can be requested from [Dominik Probst](https://www.cs6.tf.fau.eu/dp) or [Torsten MÃ¼ller](https://www.cs6.tf.fau.eu/person/torsten-muller/).
